// Request


A Request instance represents the requested piece of a fetch() call. By passing the fetch() Request, you can make advanced and customized requests:
method – GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD
url – URL of the request
headers – associated Headers object
referrer – referrer of the request
mode – cors, no-cors, same-origin
credentials – should cookies go with the request? omit, same-origin
redirect – follow, error, manual
integrity – subresource integrity value
cache – cache mode (default, reload, no-cache)


// GET requests

Here, we get a response, and the response is Stream object and the response we get is not JSON but a simple Javascript object with a series of methods that we can use further to process our data whichever way we want.
clone() – This method implies this method creates a clone of the response.
json() – This method resolves the promise with JSON.
redirect() – This method creates a new response but with a different URL.
text() – In this case, it resolves with a string.
arrayBuffer() – In here we return a promise that resolves with an ArrayBuffer.
blob() – This is one determines with a Blob.
formData() – Also returns a promise but one that determines with FormData object.
